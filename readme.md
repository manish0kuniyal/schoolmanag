The app provides a default shortened link (e.g., https://linkdrip.com/abc123) that automatically tracks referrers and appends query parameters.
The app also allows users to create custom versions of the link if they prefer manual control.

## Extra for the app

Allow users to create branded short URLs (e.g., short.ly/myproduct), not just random strings.
